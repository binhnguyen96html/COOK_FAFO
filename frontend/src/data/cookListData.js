      "Bun Bo Hue is a spicy Vietnamese Beef Noodle soup that is not quite as popular as Pho but should not be overlooked! This authentic bun bo hue noodle soup is beefy, spicy & has a robust broth. If you love Pho and you love a bit of spice then definitely give Bun Bo Hue a try.",

    recipes: [
      "The Broth - Preparing the bun bo Hue broth is a detailed and time-consuming process that is rewarding. In my recipe, beef bone and lemongrass form the base of the broth, while annatto seed oil imparts color and sate chili oil adds spice. The broth-making process is a sophisticated one involving stewing the beef and pork bones. My broth is incomplete without the use of lemongrass, chile oil, and fermented shrimp paste. To keep the broth clear, you must occasionally skim the bubbles from the boil. This process maintains the broth clarity and helps retain a sweet but spicy taste. Fish sauce, which has a distinct umami flavor, is another of my go-to additions to the broth.",
      "Cha lua: Cha lua is a Vietnamese ham you can use as a topping for bun bo Hue. It is a steamed pork sausage that you can slice thinly to garnish your dish. Alternatively, beef tenderloin and sliced beef shank are also excellent garnishes.",
      "The Sate - spicy noodle dish has a chili paste that pairs perfectly with it. The chili oil or sate is the star of bun bo Hue. It is characteristically spicy, garlicky, and filled with lemongrass flavor. I make my sate using dried Thai chile, chili powder/flakes, lemongrass, garlic, shallots, and a bit of sugar. The sugar and shallots balance out the heat from the chili. In order to make a rich and savory paste, you need to rehydrate the chili in water, shred the other flavorings, and put everything in a skillet over medium heat till it becomes thick. I also add some fish sauce to the mix to heighten the flavors. Instead of fish oil, you can use shrimp paste. Shrimp paste locally made in Hue has a bright pink color and strong umami flavors. After the broth has been prepared, serve with a spoonful or two, depending on taste. To give diners more control over the spiciness, I typically serve the paste in a small bowl.",
      "Banana blossoms - Banana flowers are another common addition I make to bun bo Hue. Banana flowers can be quite difficult to find and prepare, so skip them if you cannot find banana blossoms. Many restaurants typically substitute banana flowers with thinly sliced red cabbage. However, to prepare, I remove the little fronds and petals and soak them in lemon water to prevent browning.",
      "Fresh vegetables - What is a Vietnamese dish without herbs? I use Thai basil, fish mint, red onions, bean sprouts, and lime wedges for our recipe.",
      "Pork Patty Roll - Cha lua is a Vietnamese ham you can use as a topping for bun bo Hue. It is a steamed pork sausage that you can slice thinly to garnish your dish. Alternatively, beef tenderloin and sliced beef shank are also excellent garnishes."

      "Vietnamese broken rice is a cornerstone of Vietnamese cuisine especially when you talk about Com Tam or Vietnamese rice dishes. Included in this post is a step-by-step guide on how to make broken rice, what it means to Vietnamese cuisine, and which dishes to serve it with.",
    recipes: [
      "Prepare the Broken Rice - Rinse the broken rice thoroughly in cold water until the water runs clear. In a saucepan, combine the rinsed broken rice with 2 cups of water. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce the heat to low, cover with a lid, and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes or until the rice is tender and the water is absorbed.",
      "Grill the pork chops: Preheat your grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Remove the marinated pork chops from the refrigerator and let them sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes before cooking. This helps the meat cook more evenly.",
      "Prepare Pickled Vegetables (Do Chua) - In a bowl, combine warm water, rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Stir until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Add the julienned carrots and daikon radish to the vinegar mixture, ensuring they are submerged. Let the vegetables sit in the pickling liquid for at least 30 minutes before using. They can be prepared ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator.",
      "Assemble The Dish - Arrange a portion of the cooked broken rice on a plate. Next, top the rice with the grilled pork slices, pickled vegetables, sliced cucumber, sliced tomatoes, and fresh herbs. Then garnish with fried shallots (if using) and thinly sliced scallions. Finally, sprinkle Vietnamese dipping sauce on top and enjoy.",

      "Vietnamese Spring Roll or Gỏi Cuốn Tôm Thịt is a refreshing appetizer made up of shrimp, pork, thin rice vermicelli noodles, and an assortment of vegetables and Vietnamese herbs rolled in rice paper. Sometimes, it’s referred to as summer rolls.",
    recipes: [
      "Rice paper wrappers - These are the thin, translucent wrappers that Vietnamese spring rolls are made with. They are dry and brittle when you buy them, but they become pliable when lightly wet. You can find them in the dried noodle aisle of most Asian grocery stores. They come in squares and rounds, but I prefer the round rice paper wrappers. Round wrappers have less overlap on the ends of the spring rolls. Too much rice paper overlap can be gummy and chewy.",
      "Thin dried rice vermicelli noodles: These are a type of rice noodle that is cooked until soft. You should be able to find them in the same aisle as the rice paper wrappers in most Asian grocery stores.",
      "Large shrimp (size 21-25): Purchase large shrimp that have been peeled and deveined to save time. Boil them until they just turn color (opaque). Avoid overcooking as they will shrink too much and become rubbery. You can also purchase cooked shrimp to save even more time.Slice the shrimp in half down the spine so that they lay flat and thin for easy rolling.",
      "Pork shoulder and pork belly: Pork belly is the more traditional cut, but you can use pork shoulder for a leaner version. Simply boil it on its own, or with smashed ginger and sliced shallots for a bit more fragrant, then slice thin.",
      "Lettuce: A refreshing addition to Vietnamese spring rolls that everyone loves. ",
      "Optional vegetables and herbs: There are many different vegetables and herbs that can be added to Vietnamese spring rolls. These include but not limited to mint, perilla, sorrel, cilantro, garlic chives, bean sprouts and cucumbers.",
